- [FAQUAD NLI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8923668) (15-shot) - FaQuAD is a Portuguese reading comprehension dataset that follows the format of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). The dataset aims to address the problem of abundant questions sent by academics whose answers are found in available institutional documents in the Brazilian higher education system. It consists of 900 questions about 249 reading passages taken from 18 official documents of a computer science college from a Brazilian federal university and 21 Wikipedia articles related to the Brazilian higher education system. FaQuAD-NLI is a modified version of the FaQuAD dataset that repurposes the question answering task as a textual entailment task between a question and its possible answers. - Data sources:  [[1]](https://github.com/liafacom/faquad/),  [[2]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ruanchaves/faquad-nli)
