## Dataset Description

- **Repository:** https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/Aira
- **Point of Contact:** [AIRES at PUCRS](nicholas@airespucrs.org)

### Dataset Summary

This dataset contains a collection of single-turn conversations between an assistant and a user. Conversations were generated by user interactions with already-tuned models (ChatGPT, LLama 2, Open-Assistant, etc). The dataset is available in Portuguese and English.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

This dataset can be utilized for various natural language processing tasks, including but not limited to:

- Language modeling.
- Question-answering systems.
- Chatbot development.
- Evaluation of language models.
- Alignment research.

### Languages

English and Portuguese.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

The dataset consists of the following features:

- **Conversation ID:** Identifier of the conversation.
- **Conversations:** A list of dictionaries following a [chat format](https://github.com/huggingface/blog/blob/main/chat-templates.md).

### Data Fields

```python
[
  {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is a language model?'},
  {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A language model is a probability distribution over a vocabulary.'},
]
```

### Data Splits

Available splits are `english` and `portuguese`.

```python

from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("nicholasKluge/instruct-aira-dataset-v2", split='portuguese')

```

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was developed are part of [Nicholas Kluge's](https://nkluge-correa.github.io/) doctoral dissertation, "_Dynamic Normativity: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Value Alignment._" This research was funded by CNPq (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul), FAPERGS (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul), and DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst), as part of a doctoral research project tied to Philosophy departments of PUCRS (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul) and the University of Bonn.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

All completions were generated by querying already-tuned models (ChatGPT, LLama 2, Open-Assistant, etc.). Prompts were gathered from publicly available datasets.

#### Who are the source language producers?

All completions were generated by querying already-tuned models (ChatGPT, LLama 2, Open-Assistant, etc.). Prompts were gathered from publicly available datasets.

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

All completions were generated by querying already-tuned models (ChatGPT, LLama 2, Open-Assistant, etc.). Prompts were gathered from publicly available datasets.

#### Who are the annotators?

No annotators were used.

### Personal and Sensitive Information

No personal or sensitive information is part of this dataset.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

No considerations.

### Discussion of Biases

No considerations.

### Other Known Limitations

No considerations.
